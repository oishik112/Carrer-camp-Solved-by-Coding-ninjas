Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to print the answer.
Note : For this question, you can assume that 0 raised to the power of 0 is 1


import java.util.Scanner;
public class Solution {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Write your code here
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int x = sc.nextInt();
        int p = 1;
        for(int i=1; i<=x; i++){
            p = p*n;
            
        }
        System.out.println(p);
    }
}
